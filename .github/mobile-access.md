# Mobile Access Guide

## HTTPS Server Setup

The development server now runs with trusted HTTPS certificates generated by mkcert. This allows secure access from mobile devices without certificate warnings.

### Accessing from Mobile

1. **Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network**

2. **Use the Network URL shown when starting the server:**
   ```
   https://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:3001
   ```
   (The IP address is displayed when you run `./dev-queb-space`)

3. **No certificate warnings!** The mkcert certificates are trusted on your Mac, and mobile browsers will accept them for local network addresses.

### Features

- ✅ Works on iOS and Android browsers
- ✅ No "unsafe" certificate warnings
- ✅ Supports camera access (required for HTTPS)
- ✅ Works with modern browser APIs that require secure context

### Certificate Details

- Generated using `mkcert` (locally-trusted development certificates)
- Valid for: localhost, 127.0.0.1, your local IP, and *.mol.local
- Location: `backend/api/certs/`
- Expires: November 8, 2027

### Regenerating Certificates

If you need to regenerate certificates (e.g., IP address changed):

```bash
cd backend/api/certs
mkcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1 $(ipconfig getifaddr en0)
```
