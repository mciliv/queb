# App rules

# Dev workflow
- After edits that affect the frontend or backend, run `./dev --quick` in an independent process. If it is already running, leave it running.
- Always run `./cleanup` before starting `dev` if ports/processes are stuck.
- When I ask to “show” or “see” the app, ensure `./dev --quick` is running and point to http://localhost:3000.

# Logging/console
- For local debugging, prefer `NODE_ENV=debug ./dev --quick` to enable backend `log.*` emitters.
- Frontend `console.log` is forwarded to the server via `/api/log-error`; use it during dev only.

# Tests
- Use `npm run test:quick` during iteration. Do not block the dev server on failing tests.

# Browser automation
- The dev browser manager should remain enabled (auto-close on change, reopen after build) via `scripts/dev-browser.js`.
