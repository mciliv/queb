# Claude-4 instructions
Never assume perfection

# General
Maximally simple & straightforward
Use code instead of anything meta wherever possible
If anything can be seen as a principle, put here
No logging
Show existing code chunks wherever possible instead of descriptions
Don't create extraneous files; no markdown, if anything, simplify the code & tell me why to look at it
create least files/codelines possible under contraint of a file providing our clearest thinkinkable abstraction
cleanup after creating anything new

# Conventions
Name files, variables, functions, classes specifically
