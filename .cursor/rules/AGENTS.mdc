# Claude-4 instructions
Never assume perfection

# General
Maximally simple & straightforward
Use code instead of anything meta wherever possible
If anything can be seen as a principle, put here
No logging
Show existing code chunks wherever possible instead of descriptions
Don't create extraneous files; no markdown, if anything, simplify the code & tell me why to look at it
cleanup after creating anything new

run `dev` at end of every ∆
If all tests pass,
```sh
git commit -am "Brief description"
git push origin main
```

# Conventions
Name files, variables, functions, classes specifically
