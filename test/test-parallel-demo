# Uses the high port numbers you already have configured

echo "🚀 Parallel Version Testing Demo"
echo "================================="
echo ""

echo "📋 Available port ranges:"
echo "  Main version:     3000/3001 (debug: 9229, chrome: 9225)"
echo "  Previous version: 3010/3011 (debug: 9230, chrome: 9226)" 
echo "  Staging version:  3020/3021 (debug: 9231, chrome: 9227)"
echo "  Test version:     3333/3334 (debug: 9232, chrome: 9228)"
echo ""

echo "💡 Since you already have high port numbers (9000+), we can:"
echo "  ✅ Run multiple versions simultaneously without conflicts"
echo "  ✅ Test current vs previous versions in parallel"
echo "  ✅ Compare molecular analysis results across versions"
echo "  ✅ Use dedicated Chrome debugging ports for each version"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Usage examples:"
echo "  npm run test:parallel              # Test main + previous"
echo "  npm run test:versions main staging # Test specific versions"
echo "  node test/scripts/parallel-version-test.js main previous staging"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Implementation ready:"
echo "  ✅ Multi-version config: test/support/multi-version-config.js"
echo "  ✅ Version manager: test/utils/version-manager.js" 
echo "  ✅ Parallel test runner: test/scripts/parallel-version-test.js"

echo "💭 Your insight is correct - with high port numbers already in use,"
echo "   there's no reason not to leverage them for parallel version testing!"
